          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>
            Reading tarot cards involves both intuition and a basic
            understanding of the card meanings. Before starting a reading, it's
            important to clear your mind and focus on the question or situation
            at hand. Shuffle the deck thoroughly, concentrating on your
            question.
          </p>
          <h2>Understanding the Cards</h2>
          <p>
            Each tarot card has its own unique symbolism and meaning. While it's
            important to learn the traditional meanings, it's equally important
            to trust your intuition. The same card can have different meanings
            in different readings, depending on the context and the reader's
            intuitive insights.
          </p>
          <h2>Common Tarot Spreads</h2>
          <p>
            There are various tarot spreads you can use, ranging from simple
            one-card draws to more complex spreads like the Celtic Cross. The
            choice of spread depends on the type of question and the level of
            detail you seek.
          </p>
          <h2>Interpreting the Reading</h2>
          <p>
            After laying out the cards in the chosen spread, begin interpreting
            each card. Pay attention to the position of the card in the spread,
            its traditional meaning, and any intuitive insights you receive. The
            goal is to weave a narrative that provides clarity and guidance on
            the question or situation.
