          <h2>What is a Specific Question Tarot Reading?</h2>
          <p>
            A specific question tarot reading is designed to provide answers to
            a particular question you have. This could be about relationships,
            career, finances, or any other area of your life where you seek
            guidance.
          </p>
          <h2>Formulating Your Question</h2>
          <p>
            When formulating your question, it's important to be clear and
            specific. Avoid vague or broad questions. Instead, focus on a
            particular aspect of your situation that you need clarity on. For
            example, instead of asking, "Will I be successful?" you might ask,
            "What steps can I take to achieve success in my career?"
          </p>
          <h2>Performing the Reading</h2>
          <p>
            Shuffle the deck while focusing on your question. Lay out the cards
            in a spread that suits your needs. A three-card spread is often used
            for specific questions, with each card representing the past,
            present, and future or different aspects of the situation.
          </p>
          <h2>Interpreting the Cards</h2>
          <p>
            Consider the meaning of each card in the context of your question.
            Pay attention to the card's position in the spread and any intuitive
            insights you receive. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of
            the situation and the guidance the cards are offering.
